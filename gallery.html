             <div class="g-text1"><p>Otl’s style is strong and direct. It is simple, but with order and planning. He believed art should exemplify reason and be used for problem-solving. Throughout his life, he saw a need to find a “comprehensive iteration between life and design” and did so through exploration of the world and research into politics of thought and design.</p></div>

            <div class="g-text2"><p>When Aicher opened his final firm, he did so with the intention of creating a space to explore non-client projects. In one case, he wanted to develop a complex color manual. In describing his needs to an associate designer, he said “think of nasturtiums and think of dark roses” to explain the difference between vibrant colors and muted, dark shades. The result was the Ludenscheid Manual which had over four billion potential combinations. The original Pantone one might say.</p></div>
