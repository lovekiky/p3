During a walk, he pointed towards the mountains and said: “What you see here is the complete colour palette for the Munich Olympics. The light blue of the lake in the foreground, the silver of the glittering waves, the light green of the spring fields, the dark green of the nearby forests, the violet of the forests further in the distance, the silvery-blue mountains in the background and the vibrant blue of the sky above.”
